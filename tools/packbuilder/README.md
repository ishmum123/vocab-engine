# packbuilder

A shared, language-configurable builder for vocab-engine packs. It builds `pack/{pack,words,sentences,attribution}.json` and `tools/REPORT.md` in a language repo from public sources:

- a subtitle frequency list,
- `wordfreq`,
- a kaikki.org Wiktionary extract,
- Tatoeba sentences with English translations and audio.

A new language needs a language module (`langs/<code>.py`) and a few data files in its own repo. It does not need a fork of the pipeline.

The Italian pack (`key: "it"`) was the first language. The shared builder reproduces it byte for byte.

## Layout

```
packbuilder/
  cli.py              python3 -m packbuilder {build,check,scan,sample} --lang <code> --repo <path>
  core/               language-agnostic stages
    sources.py        downloads into <repo>/.cache, the Tatoeba corpus stage, audio recorders
    tag.py            truecasing and spaCy tagging (cached)
    lex.py            kaikki -> compact lexicon + form map (cached)
    lexicon.py        token -> (lemma, POS) resolution with context rules
    freq.py           corpus usage pass, frequency blend
    english.py        English stemming for gloss <-> translation overlap
    gloss.py          gloss cleaning, sense ranking
    words.py          pool, entry/sense choice, second-POS entries, levels (assign_levels), ids (assign_ids)
    sentences.py      in-context links, sentence choice, -rsi gate
    report.py         REPORT.md (keeps the manual section)
    pipeline.py       stage driver, pack.json, attribution.json
  langs/base.py       LanguageSpec: the interface and its defaults
  langs/it.py         Italian
  qa/check.py         hard gate: schema, ids, levels, coverage, spec.check_word
  qa/scans.py         review scans 1-3 (gloss junk, articles/closed sets, non-lemmas)
  qa/sample.py        stratified word/sentence samples for hand QA
  tests/test_spec.py  stdlib unittest smoke tests
  requirements.txt
```

## Language repo contract

A language repo includes vocab-engine as a submodule at `engine/`, and it holds these files:

```
pack/                      generated pack (commit it)
tools/build_pack.py        shim: PYTHONPATH=engine/tools python3 -m packbuilder build --lang <code> --repo .
tools/gloss_overrides.json hand gloss fixes, "lemma|pos": "gloss" (keys starting with _ are comments)
tools/forced_a1.txt        A1 core list: [NOUN] / [VERB] / [ADJ] / [ADV] headers, then lemmas
tools/id_map_v1.json       frozen "lemma|pos" -> word id (keeps learner progress across rebuilds)
tools/REPORT.md            generated; text between <!-- manual:begin/end --> is kept
build.sh check.sh README.md TODO.md
.cache/                    gitignored: downloads + derived/ (corpus, tagged corpus, lexicon)
```

Caches are keyed by `LanguageSpec.versions` and the source file names and sizes. Bump a version when that stage's code, or the language's rules for that stage, change. Otherwise the cached tagged corpus is reused. Tagging is the slow stage, about 7 minutes for 650k sentences.

## Commands

```sh
pip install -r engine/tools/packbuilder/requirements.txt   # plus the language's spaCy model, see below
export PYTHONPATH=engine/tools                             # from the language repo
python3 -m packbuilder build  --lang it --repo .           # [--stage corpus|tag|lex|freq|words|all] [--check-remote]
python3 -m packbuilder check  --lang it --repo .           # exit 1 on failure
python3 -m packbuilder scan   --lang it --repo . [--only 1|2|3]
python3 -m packbuilder sample --lang it --repo . --seed 303
python3 -m unittest discover -s engine/tools/packbuilder/tests -t engine/tools
```

To work on packbuilder itself against a language repo, point the shim at your checkout with `PACKBUILDER_PATH=../vocab-engine/tools python3 tools/build_pack.py`.

## spaCy models and licences

The model runs at build time only, and packs ship no model files. The model licence still limits how the project can be used.

| lang | model | licence | trained on | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| it | `it_core_news_sm` 3.8.0 | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 | UD Italian ISDT, WikiNER | non-commercial only |
| es | `es_core_news_sm` 3.8.0 | GNU GPL 3.0 | UD Spanish AnCora, WikiNER | copyleft |
| fr | `fr_core_news_sm` 3.8.0 | LGPL-LR | UD French Sequoia, WikiNER | |
| ru | `ru_core_news_sm` 3.8.0 | MIT | Nerus | |
| fa | none | | | spaCy 3.8 has no Persian pipeline. Another tagger is needed. |

These licences were checked against `explosion/spacy-models` `meta/<model>-3.8.0.json` on 2026-09-23. Install a model with its wheel, for example:

```sh
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/es_core_news_sm-3.8.0/es_core_news_sm-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Adding a language

1. **Verify sources and their licences.** Record each one in the language README's sources table.
   - Subtitle frequency: hermitdave/FrequencyWords `content/2018/<code>/<code>_full.txt`, CC-BY-SA 4.0.
   - `wordfreq`: check that the language is supported.
   - kaikki.org extract: `https://kaikki.org/dictionary/<Name>/kaikki.org-dictionary-<Name>.jsonl.gz`, CC-BY-SA 3.0/GFDL. Check that its `lang_code` is what you expect.
   - Tatoeba `<iso3>_sentences_detailed.tsv.bz2`, CC-BY 2.0 FR. Count the sentences that have an English link. The Italian pack had 650k.
   - Optionally, a CEFR list for the Kelly-style cross-check. It is never shipped.
2. **Choose the spaCy model and record its licence.** Use the table above. The licence goes into `tagger_attribution` and the README. When no model exists (fa), stop and decide on a tagger first. The tagging stage expects spaCy.
3. **Copy `langs/it.py` to `langs/<code>.py`** and fill in these fields:
   - Identity: `code`, `name_en`, `pack_name`, `tts`, `stt`, `tatoeba_code`.
   - Sources: `sources` and the role file names (`subtitles_file`, `kaikki_file`, `sentences_file`, `kelly_file`).
   - Model: `spacy_model`.
   - Cache versions: set `versions` to `c1`/`t1`/`l1`.
   - Orthography: `word_re`, `lex_word_re`, `sub_token_re`, `form_target_re` and `fem_of_re` for the alphabet. Set `accent_variants` only if the subtitles drop accents.
   - Wiktionary: `noun_head_template` (for example `es-noun`, `fr-noun`), `regional_tags`, and `group_kpos` if the UD and Wiktionary POS conventions differ.
   - Report wording: `report_title`, `forced_description`, `numeral_exclusion`, `marked_past_name`.
4. **Fill the forced sets.** `forced_closed` holds days, months, numbers, colours, greetings and any other closed sets. `no_article` holds nouns shown bare, and `allowed_num` holds the numerals allowed as words. Write the repo's `tools/forced_a1.txt`, an A1 core list of about 150-200 everyday words.
5. **Set up articles and gender.**
   - Fill `article_forms`, `definite_article`, `fixed_word` and `fixed_gloss` for the articles.
   - Fill `pluralia_tantum`.
   - Override `default_gender`, `noun_display` (how a noun is shown with its article) and `check_word` (the hard article assertion). Russian and Persian have no articles, so keep the base versions: nouns are shown bare.
6. **Set up clitics and reflexives.**
   - Fill `clitic_re` (verb + enclitic) and `mono_imperative`, and `art_prep` for articulated prepositions.
   - Fill `clitic_of`, `refl_clitics` and `copulas`, and set `verb_endings`.
   - Override `pronominal_base`/`pronominal_form` (it: -rsi; es: -rse; fr: se + verb, usually `None`), and override `is_reflexive`/`carries_refl_clitic`/`stative_aux` to match the language.
   - Override `is_marked_past` only for a literary tense that should be kept to the top level (it: passato remoto). Spanish preterite is everyday and must not be marked.
   - Tables left empty switch their rule off.
7. **Add hand tables only after a QA round shows a need.** These are `gloss_overrides.json`, `drop_keys`, `apocope`, `multiword`, `profanity` and `bad_text_re`. Fix categories with a rule first; a hand table is for residuals.
8. **Run and check.** Run `build`, then `check`, then `python3 engine/tools/validate_pack.py pack`, then `./build.sh`. Run the unit tests. The every-language test checks the new module's required fields.
9. **Do three QA rounds.** Each round runs `scan` and reads every "should be empty" list. It then runs `sample` with a new seed and hand-checks the samples. Rounds so far used seeds 7, 303 and 404. Fix the rule behind each finding, rebuild, and record the rules, counts and seeds in the manual section of `tools/REPORT.md`. The pack ships when all of these hold:
   - at least 95% correct primary sense on the 60-word stratified sample,
   - 0 wrong POS in the top 300 by rank,
   - at least 95% link accuracy on the 60-sentence sample, counted over its links,
   - every closed set complete at the first level (scan 3),
   - `check` passes and the validator reports 0 errors.
10. **Browser verification.** Build `index.html` and check the pack in a real browser: every tab, TTS voice for the locale, typing with accents at each level, gap items, and audio playback. Check at phone width, 390px.
11. **Publish.**
    - Create a public repo `<language>` with `engine/` as a submodule, and commit `pack/`, `index.html` and `tools/` data.
    - Enable GitHub Pages from the repo root.
    - When the language module is new or changed in vocab-engine, commit that there first. Then bump the submodule in the language repo with `git submodule update --remote engine`, rebuild, and check that `./check.sh` passes.

## Determinism

The build has no randomness. Every iteration over sets and dicts that affects output is sorted, and gzip caches are written with `mtime=0`. Two runs with different `PYTHONHASHSEED` values give byte-identical `pack/*.json` and `REPORT.md`. Recheck this after adding a language.
